## Specification design pattern
In computer programming, the specification pattern is a particular software design pattern, whereby business rules can be recombined by chaining the business rules together using boolean logic. The pattern is frequently used in the context of domain-driven design.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20the%20specification,context%20of%20domain%2Ddriven%20design.)

This demonstrates how to implement the specification design pattern.
